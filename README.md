A deep dive into *GoodCabs*, a tier-2 city cab service.

#### Project Overview
GoodCabs operates in tier-2 cities, serving tourists and business travelers. My analysis uncovered valuable insights into demand trends, customer preferences, and growth drivers.

#### Key Insights
🏙️ **City Trends**: Jaipur leads in trip volume and average trip distance, while Surat lags behind.
🗓️ **Peak Demand**: Business hubs thrive on weekdays, while weekends see spikes in tourist hotspots.
🔁 **Repeat Passengers**: Business cities show higher repeat rates for shorter trips, yet ratings don't correlate with loyalty—new passengers provide higher ratings!
🌦️ **External Factors**: Climate and holidays significantly impact trip demand.
